# LSTM, GRU and Tanh Model
This repository compared the LSTM, GRU, and traditional tanh models. These three models are trained using [JSB-Chorales](https://github.com/czhuang/JSB-Chorales-dataset) and [Nottingham datasets](https://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/) datasets. The implementation of these models is based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3555).
